## NJ Movies V2

_WIP_

Version two of my [Movies repo](https://github.com/Nathanjms/nathanjms-movies), this time written in typescript, along with a better design and using my [new NodeJS API](https://github.com/Nathanjms/nj-node-api).

### Setup

1. Set up https://github.com/Nathanjms/nj-node-api by following the `readme` instructions in that Repository.
2. Run `cp .env.example .env`
3. Update the credentials in the `.env` file
4. Run `npm start`
5. If you have ran the db seeder in nj-node-api, you should now be able to login with:
    - Username: `nj1@test.com` 
    - Password: `123456`
